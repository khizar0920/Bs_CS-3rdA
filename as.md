### Data Types and Representations
- **Cardinal Data Types**: Bits, bit strings, bit slices, binary integers, binary floating-point numbers, binary encoded decimals, binary addresses, characters, etc.
- **Hardware Implementation**: Different processors implement data types in hardware, and assembly language programmers must understand how the hardware manages these types. Concerns include bit ordering (big endian or little endian), number of bits/bytes, word length, addressing boundaries, etc.
- **Machine-Specific Encodings**: Machines may have specific encodings for certain data types, character codes (like ASCII or EBCDIC), and details of composite data types (mantissa, characteristic, sign, etc.).

### Data Sizes and Groupings
- **Bit**: Basic unit containing binary data (true/false, zero/one).
- **Byte**: Typically eight bits; the smallest addressable unit in modern computers.
- **Nibble**: Half a byte, or four bits.
- **Word**: Default data size for a processor, chosen by its designer(s). Common sizes: 16, 32 bits. Additional sizes defined relative to the word size: halfword, longword, doubleword, quadword.
- **Alignment**: Some processors require data to be aligned on specific boundaries (e.g., two-byte quantities on multiples of two). Unaligned data might result in performance slowdowns.

### Examples of Processor Data Sizes and Alignment Rules
1. **DEC VAX (16-bit)**
   - Word: 16 bits (2 bytes)
   - Longword: 32 bits (4 bytes)
   - Quadword: 64 bits (8 bytes)
   - Octaword: 132 bits (16 bytes)
   - Unaligned data allowed with a speed penalty

2. **IBM 360/370 (32-bit)**
   - Word: 32 bits (4 bytes)
   - Half-word: 16 bits (2 bytes)
   - Doubleword: 64 bits (8 bytes)
   - Requires alignment on full-word boundaries

3. **Intel 80x86 (16/32-bit)**
   - Word: 16 bits (2 bytes)
   - Doubleword: 32 bits (4 bytes)
   - Unaligned data allowed with a speed penalty

4. **MIX Architecture**
   - Byte of unspecified size, accommodates binary and decimal operations, holds values 0 to 63 (6 bits or 2 decimal digits)
   - Word: One sign and five bytes

5. **Motorola 680x0 / 68300**
   - Byte: 8 bits
   - Word: 16 bits (2 bytes)
   - Long/long word: 32 bits (4 bytes)
   - Quadword: 64 bits (8 bytes)
   - Unaligned data allowed with speed penalty, instructions require word boundaries

These descriptions highlight the diversity in data representations, sizes, and alignment requirements across various processor architectures. Understanding these details is crucial for assembly language programmers when working at the hardware level.


### Endianness
- **Endian**: The arrangement of bytes in multibyte scalar data.
- **Big Endian**: Stores scalars with the most significant byte in the lowest numeric byte address.
  - Examples: IBM System 360/370, Motorola 680x0, Motorola 68300, most RISC processors.
- **Little Endian**: Stores scalars with the least significant byte in the lowest numeric byte address.
  - Examples: Digital VAX, Intel x86 (including Pentium).
- **Bi-Endian**: Processors capable of operating in both big and little-endian modes under software control.
  - Example: Motorola/IBM PowerPC, controlled by specific bits in the Machine State Register (ILE for interrupts, LE for other processes).

### Number Systems
- **Binary**: Utilizes 0s and 1s (base-2).
- **Decimal**: Based on 10 digits (0-9) (base-10).
- **Hexadecimal**: Based on 16 digits (0-9 and A-F) (base-16).
- **Octal**: Based on 8 digits (0-7) (base-8).
- **Duodecimal**: Based on 12 digits (0-9 and A-B) (base-12).

Here's a conversion table among binary, octal, decimal, duodecimal, and hexadecimal:

```
